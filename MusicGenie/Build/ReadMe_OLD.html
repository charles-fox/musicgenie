To do the last step on Windows, open the file called MusicGenie.bat in Notepad.  Change the drive letter on the first line to the drive that it's installed on (eg. C or D).  Change the filepath on the second line to the folder that its installed in.  eg. if it's on Drive C, in folder Program Files/Charles/MusicGenie then change it to:
<pre>
C:\
cd \Program Files\Charles\MusicGenie
java -cp . uk.ac.cam.cwf22.mg.MusicGenie

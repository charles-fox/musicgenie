Update: 2004-08-01
Just noticed a problem with Sun's new Java 1.4: when you click Edit to
open the editor, the window may be blank.  You can fix this by double-clicking
the title bar (to resize the window) which forces it to redraw.
This bug is due to Sun changing the behavior of Java since I wrote the code!
I recommend using Java 1.3 as supplied with MusicGenie, as this is the 
verzion of Java that MusicGenie was designed for!

DEMOS
Some of them are in MusicGenie .gen format, which you can load from the file menu; others are saved as text files which you can cut and paste into the editor.
